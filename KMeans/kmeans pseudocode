Pseudocode k means


n <- number of features
f <- array of features
k <- number of clusters

Loop through 0 to k-1
	New Centroid <- [random(lower f1-upper f1),random(lower f2-upper f2),...,random(lower fn-upper fn)]

f <- array of features
v <- selected vector
c <- selected centroid

loop through 0 to n-1
    euclidean distance <- euclidean distance + (v-c)^2
sqrt(euclidean distance)

n <- number of features
f <- array of features
k <- number of clusters

Loop x through 0 to k-1
    new Centroid <- [(average(f1 where in x) + average(f2 where in x) + ... + average(fn where in x))/k]

k <- number of clusters

Loop x through 1 to k
    if euclidean distance to centroid x < euclidean distance to centroid smallest
        smallest <- centroid x
